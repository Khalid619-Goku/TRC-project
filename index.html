                            <h1>Super Cars</h1>
                            <p>The supercar is a high-end race-ready production car, a mark of status and exclusivity, and traditionally, European in origin. Their clean lines and subtle flares reflect the motor sport lineages, most of which date back to the beginning of the automobile. The concept of the supercar was largely uncomfortable in America at the beginning of the 20th century but has since become a 21st century status icon for the wealthy. Then, in the year 2000, Saleen unveiled its half million-dollar S7 coupe. Before this, there has always been controversy over what can be considered a supercar in American manufacturing.  I will explain why there was hesitation towards an American supercar by contrasting the early automotive culture of America and Europe. The cultural paradigms set in early European and American automotive history naturally created a polarizing car culture that resisted an American supercar. The S7 is a localized definition that changed this paradigm within car culture.</p><br><br>
                            L.J.K Setright of the Daily Telegraph, first coined the term supercar, such collaborative effort as Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Porsche have established the paradigm of the supercar.

                        <h5>THE 1950S</h5>
While the term ‘supercar’ may have been used in the 1920s, it wasn’t until the mid-1950s that sports cars with outstanding performance really entered the marketplace. Early pioneers for the supercar segment included the 1954 Mercedes 300SL and the 1953 Chevrolet Corvette C1.

<h5>THE 1960S</h5>
In the mid-1960s supercars as we think of them today began to release. Some significant developments in the 60s include the creation of the Ford GT, which came about because Ferrari refused to join Ford, and the release of the mid-engined Lamborghini Miura, which was designed from the start as a road car. The Ford GT became a staple of the supercar and American muscle car scene, proving performance and exquisite design can go hand-in-hand.

<h5>THE 1970S</h5>
A fuel crisis in the early 70s almost ended the supercar, but they managed to survive and grow from here. The first mass-market turbo road cars, including the likes of the Porsche 911 Turbo, were released. The 911 Turbo stood out with its eccentric design elements and stellar performance. With the birth of the 911 Turbo, Porsche cemented themselves in the supercar scene, and have remained there to this day.

Arguably the most important supercar of this generation was the Lamborghini Countach. This mid-engine model had a striking design that stood out among the pack. It’s V12 engine was longitudinally-mounted with slight modifications to the Miura’s engine placement. The end result had the engine sandwiched between the rear differential and mid-mounted transmission. The Countach remains a favorite among supercar fanatics and gearheads around the world, and rightfully so.

                            <h2>Hypercar</h2>
                             A hypercar can be defined as the most superior and high-performance cars on the market worldwide. Only 1% of cars are hypercars, the first one was produced in 1963, the Lamborghini Miura. This was also known as the P400. The Lamborghini Miura can accelerate to 60mph in under 6 seconds and on to a top speed of 180mph whereas one of the newest hypercars on the market can go from 0-186mph in under 9 seconds! This hypercar is the Lotus Evija electric hypercar (pronounced ih-via), the name means ‘the living one’. The Lotus Evija is highly exclusive as only 130 will ever be built. This puts the Lotus Evija at the top as the most powerful supercar to ever be built plus it is fully electric taking only 18 minutes on a 350-kilowatt charge. If you have a spare £2 million sat in your bank account then this Lotus Evija could be yours.
                                <h5>The Elements Of A Hypercar</h5>
                                Here we discuss the main elements that make up a Hypercar. Differentiating this from your average daily commute to work car to the top of the range Supercar.<br><br>
<h6>Limited releases</h6>
Hypercars are exclusive, car manufacturer Lotus has recently released the new electric car, Lotus Evija and will only make 130 of them ever. It is possible to rent supercars around £20,000 for 24 hours but it will most likely only be for movie productions, photoshoots, and trade shows.<br><br>
<h6>Appearance</h6>
The world's high-performance cars have mind-blowing designs. These cars are unique and individual, we are instantly drawn to their design and appearance.<br><br>
<h6>Cost</h6>
Cost is a crucial factor, with the top of the range specs and designed with every small detail in mind it comes as no surprise that the cost of a Hypercar is in its millions. For example, the cost of a Bugatti, a French Hypercar cost ranges between £1 million - 2.5 million pounds. The release of the new Divo Hypercar which sold out in just one day costing £4.7 million. To show you the true cost of this performance car, the cost of an oil change whether it has been driven or not is an extortionate £17,000 due to its exclusivity. This double-checks it is running at its highest output and efficiency.<br><br>
<h6>Build quality</h6>
The build quality is what differentiates a hypercar from a sports car and a supercar is the build quality. Although a high performance hypercar is meant to be designed for elegance and high speeds, they need to last and thrive seen as many cars cannot maintain high speeds, especially above 100 miles per hour to ensure they do not become unsafe. Referring back to the cost, they are expensive and need to be built to a top quality standard to ensure the safety of the driver, passengers, and road drivers.
